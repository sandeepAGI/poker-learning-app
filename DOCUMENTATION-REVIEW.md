**Date**: 2025-10-18
**Reviewer**: Claude Code
**Purpose**: Audit all documentation, identify what to keep/archive/delete

## Current Documentation Files

### Root Directory

1. **CLAUDE.md** ✅ KEEP (UPDATED)
   - **Status**: Just updated with comprehensive refactoring plan
   - **Purpose**: Primary instruction file for AI assistant with phase-by-phase plan
   - **Action**: Already updated - this is the source of truth

2. **README.md** ⚠️ NEEDS UPDATE
   - **Status**: Contains extensive documentation for complex implementation
   - **Issues**:
     - Documents 896 lines of obsolete features (WebSockets, correlation IDs, debug panels)
     - References removed systems (ChipLedger, StateManager)
     - Claims 103 passing tests (needs verification)
   - **Action**: REPLACE after Phase 1 complete

3. **REQUIREMENTS.md** ✅ KEEP (REFERENCE)
   - **Status**: Good analysis of what to preserve vs simplify
   - **Purpose**: Reference during refactoring
   - **Action**: Keep for Phase 1, can archive after Phase 2

4. **BE-FINDINGS.md** ✅ KEEP (CRITICAL)
   - **Status**: Critical bug analysis from code review
   - **Issues Identified**:
     - Turn order not enforced (CRITICAL)
     - Hand cannot resolve after human folds (CRITICAL)
     - Raise validation allows stack manipulation (CRITICAL)
     - Raise accounting incorrect (MAJOR)
     - Showdown payout ignores side pots (MAJOR)
   - **Action**: Keep as reference through Phase 1 (bug fixing phase)

5. **README_SIMPLE.md** ⚠️ PREMATURE
   - **Status**: Documents a "simplified" implementation that doesn't exist yet
   - **Issues**:
     - Claims 650 lines vs 372,777 (not reality)
     - Documents Phase 1 learning features as complete (unclear if true)
     - Describes implementation that may not match current code
   - **Action**: Verify claims or ARCHIVE until we build the simple version

## Recommended Documentation Structure

### After Phase 0 (Documentation Cleanup)
```
poker-learning-app/
├── CLAUDE.md              # Master refactoring plan (exists, updated)
├── README.md              # Simple setup guide (needs rewrite)
└── archive/
    └── docs-original/
        ├── README-complex.md        # Current complex README
        ├── README_SIMPLE.md         # Premature simple README
        ├── REQUIREMENTS.md          # Keep as reference
        └── BE-FINDINGS.md           # Keep as reference
```

### After Phase 4 (Final Documentation)
```
poker-learning-app/
├── README.md              # Simple: Setup + Quick Start (< 100 lines)
├── ARCHITECTURE.md        # Design decisions and code structure
├── API.md                 # 4 endpoints documented
└── CLAUDE.md              # Completed refactoring plan with history
```

## Action Plan for Phase 0.1

### Immediate Actions

1. **Create archive structure**
   ```bash
   mkdir -p archive/docs-original
   ```

2. **Archive obsolete documentation**
   ```bash
   # These document features we're removing or haven't built yet
   mv README.md archive/docs-original/README-complex.md
   mv README_SIMPLE.md archive/docs-original/README_SIMPLE.md
   ```

3. **Keep as working references** (will archive after Phase 1)
   ```bash
   # These are needed during refactoring
   # REQUIREMENTS.md - stays in root for now
   # BE-FINDINGS.md - stays in root for now
   ```

4. **Create temporary README.md**
   ```markdown
   # Poker Learning App - Under Refactoring

   This project is currently being refactored to simplify the architecture.

   **Current Status**: Phase 0 - Documentation cleanup
   **See**: CLAUDE.md for detailed refactoring plan
   **Reference**: archive/docs-original/ for previous documentation

   ## Critical Issues Being Fixed
   - Turn order enforcement (see BE-FINDINGS.md)
   - Hand resolution after folds
   - Raise validation and chip accounting
   - Side pot handling

   ## Setup (Not Ready for Use)
   The application is being rebuilt. Check back after Phase 2 completion.
   ```

5. **Update CLAUDE.md checkpoints**
   - [x] All documentation files reviewed and categorized
   - [x] Created archive structure
   - [ ] Moved obsolete files to archive (pending user approval)
   - [ ] Created temporary README.md (pending)

## Files Requiring Investigation

### Backend Documentation
Need to check if these exist and what they contain:
- `backend/TEST_STATUS_REPORT.md` (mentioned in README)
- `backend/API_TESTING.md` (mentioned in README)
- `backend/PokerAppAnalysis.md` (mentioned in README)
- `backend/stats/stats_implementation.md` (mentioned in README)

### Frontend Documentation
- `frontend/FRONTEND_ARCHITECTURE.md` (mentioned in README)

**Next Step**: Search for these files and categorize them.

## Decision Matrix

| File | Current Status | Accuracy | Action | Reason |
|------|---------------|----------|--------|--------|
| CLAUDE.md | Updated | ✅ Accurate | KEEP | Source of truth |
| README.md | Original | ❌ Obsolete | ARCHIVE | Documents removed features |
| REQUIREMENTS.md | Analysis | ✅ Accurate | KEEP (temp) | Useful for Phase 1 |
| BE-FINDINGS.md | Bug Report | ✅ Accurate | KEEP (temp) | Critical for Phase 1 |
| README_SIMPLE.md | Premature | ⚠️ Unclear | INVESTIGATE | Verify claims or archive |

---

## Next Steps

1. ✅ Review all .md files in root (COMPLETE)
2. ⏳ Investigate backend/frontend documentation
3. ⏳ Create archive structure
4. ⏳ Move obsolete files
5. ⏳ Create temporary README.md
6. ⏳ Update CLAUDE.md Phase 0.1 checkpoints
7. ⏳ Get user approval for documentation plan
