# Statistics Tracking System - Implementation Plan

## Phase 1: Core Statistics Framework (2 weeks)
- Implement `statistics_tracker.py` with data models:
  - PlayerStatistics: hands_played, win_rate, VPIP, PFR, aggression factor
  - HandStatistics: cards, actions, outcomes
  - SessionStatistics: tracking games over time
  - LearningStatistics: decision accuracy and improvement metrics
- Create JSON file storage structure in game-data directory
- Add unit tests for core functionality

## Phase 2: Game Engine Integration (1 week)
- Modify `game_engine.py` to record player actions
- Track hand outcomes and pot distributions
- Create hooks for statistics capture at key game points
- Ensure non-intrusive integration with existing code

## Phase 3: Analysis Features (2 weeks)
- Build StatisticsAnalyzer class for insights
- Implement leak detection algorithms
- Create performance reports by position and hand type
- Develop recommendation engine based on historical data

## Phase 4: API and Frontend (2 weeks)
- Create API endpoints:
  - /api/statistics/player/<player_id>
  - /api/statistics/hand/<hand_id>
  - /api/analysis/performance/<player_id>
  - /api/analysis/recommendation
- Design frontend visualizations for statistics
- Implement real-time updates during play

## Key Statistics to Track
- Win/loss records and rates
- VPIP (Voluntarily Put money In Pot)
- PFR (Pre-Flop Raise percentage)
- Aggression Factor (ratio of aggressive to passive actions)
- Position-based performance
- Showdown success rate
- Stack-to-pot ratio decision making
- Hand strength vs. betting patterns
