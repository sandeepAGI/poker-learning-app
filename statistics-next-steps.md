# Learning Statistics Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for the Learning Statistics component of our poker game. The primary goal is to provide novice players with helpful guidance by comparing their decisions to what different AI strategies would have done in the same situation. This will help players understand different poker playing styles and improve their decision-making.

## Core Concept

The Learning Statistics system will:
1. Evaluate human player decisions
2. Classify these decisions according to AI strategy types
3. Identify which strategy would have been optimal
4. Provide simple, actionable feedback
5. Track improvement over time

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. Create LearningStatistics Class (2 days)

```python
class LearningStatistics:
    """
    Tracks a player's decision quality and learning progress over time.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, player_id: str):
        self.player_id = player_id
        self.total_decisions = 0
        self.decisions_by_strategy = {
            "Conservative": 0,
            "Risk Taker": 0,
            "Probability-Based": 0,
            "Bluffer": 0
        }
        self.optimal_decisions = 0
        self.decision_history = []  # List of recent decisions with context
        self.improvement_by_spr = {
            "low": [],    # SPR < 3
            "medium": [], # 3 <= SPR <= 6
            "high": []    # SPR > 6
        }
```

Add methods to update and retrieve learning statistics, plus serialization support for storage.

### 2. Update StatisticsManager (1 day)

Add methods to:
- Create/retrieve LearningStatistics
- Store decision comparisons
- Calculate improvement metrics
- Link with existing PlayerStatistics

### 3. Game Engine Integration Points (3 days)

#### 3.1 Add Decision Classification Method

```python
def classify_decision(self, player_id: str, decision: str, hole_cards: List[str], 
                     game_state: Dict, deck: List[str], pot_size: int, spr: float):
    """
    Classifies a player's decision according to AI strategy types.
    Returns the matching strategy and whether it was optimal.
    """
    # Implement decision classification logic
    # Compare with what each AI type would do
    # Return classification results
```

#### 3.2 Add Hooks in Player Decision Points

Modify the following methods in game_engine.py:
- `betting_round()`: After a human player makes a decision
- `play_hand()`: At the end of each hand

#### 3.3 Create Optimal Strategy Finder

```python
def find_optimal_strategy(self, hole_cards: List[str], game_state: Dict, 
                         deck: List[str], pot_size: int, spr: float) -> str:
    """
    Determines which AI strategy would be optimal in the current situation.
    This could be the strategy that maximizes EV or best handles the specific 
    game context.
    """
    # Test each strategy
    # Return the strategy with the best outcome
```

### 4. Feedback Generation (2 days)

Create a system to generate actionable feedback for players:

```python
def generate_feedback(self, player_decision: str, optimal_decision: str, 
                     matching_strategy: str, optimal_strategy: str,
                     context: Dict) -> Dict[str, str]:
    """
    Generates personalized feedback based on a player's decision.
    """
    # Create explanation of the player's approach
    # Compare with optimal approach
    # Provide specific advice
    # Return formatted feedback
```

### 5. Statistics Analyzer Updates (2 days)

Enhance StatisticsAnalyzer to:
- Track strategy preferences over time
- Identify recurring decision patterns
- Calculate improvement rates
- Generate learning recommendations

```python
def analyze_learning_progress(self, player_id: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyzes a player's learning progress over time.
    """
    # Retrieve learning statistics
    # Calculate improvement metrics
    # Identify patterns and trends
    # Generate recommendations
```

### 6. Testing Framework (3 days)

#### 6.1 Unit Tests for LearningStatistics

Create comprehensive tests for:
- Decision classification
- Strategy comparison
- Feedback generation
- Progress tracking

#### 6.2 Integration Tests

Test the entire flow from:
- Player decision capture
- Classification and comparison
- Feedback generation
- Statistics storage and retrieval

### 7. Documentation (1 day)

- Add detailed docstrings to all new components
- Update existing documentation to reflect new capabilities
- Create examples of how to interpret learning statistics

## Implementation Sequence

1. **Week 1:**
   - Implement LearningStatistics class
   - Update StatisticsManager
   - Create basic classification method

2. **Week 2:**
   - Integrate with game engine
   - Implement feedback generation
   - Update analyzer for learning statistics

3. **Week 3:**
   - Develop testing framework
   - Complete documentation
   - Perform final integration and testing

## Technical Considerations

### Data Structure for Decision History

Store decision contexts with:
- Hand state (hole cards, community cards)
- Game state (pot size, SPR, betting position)
- Player's decision
- Matched strategy
- Optimal strategy
- Outcome (if applicable)

### Classification Methodology

Use the same thresholds and logic from AI strategies:
- Conservative: Plays only strong hands
- Risk Taker: Raises aggressively
- Probability-Based: Uses hand strength thresholds
- Bluffer: Makes unpredictable bets

### Storage Efficiency

- Keep a limited history of recent decisions (e.g., last 100)
- Store aggregated statistics for long-term trends
- Use incremental updates for efficiency

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Personalized Learning Path:**
   - Generate custom learning plans based on identified weaknesses

2. **Hand Replays:**
   - Allow players to review past hands with detailed feedback

3. **Strategy Adaptation:**
   - Suggest adjustments based on opponents' playing styles

4. **Visual Learning Dashboard:**
   - Create visual representations of learning progress

These enhancements would be implemented after the core functionality is complete and validated.
