## Why Archived?

These documents were part of the **refactoring process (Phases 0-4)** which is now complete. They provided valuable guidance during development but are no longer needed for ongoing work.

**Current work** focuses on UX enhancement with WebSocket real-time updates, animations, and learning features.
