   - Start the frontend application
   - Navigate to poker game and create a game
   - Look for "üêõ Bug Diagnostic Tool" in bottom-left corner
   - Click "Monitor Action Flow" before taking any action
   - Take a raise/call/fold action and monitor browser console output
   - **Report console output** for analysis

2. **Systematic Testing Protocol**
   ```bash
   # Test the diagnostic tool functionality
   cd frontend
   npm start
   # Follow steps above and capture console output
   ```

3. **Expected Diagnostic Output**
   - Pre-action state analysis
   - Backend response inspection
   - State mapping logic verification
   - Post-action state confirmation
   - **Identification of exact failure point**

**Likely Root Causes to Investigate**:
- Backend response structure doesn't match frontend expectations
- Timing issues in state updates (race conditions)  
- WebSocket events interfering with API responses
- Hidden state corruption during action processing
- Reducer logic edge cases not covered by current safeguards

**Development Workflow**:
1. **Capture diagnostic data** from browser console
2. **Analyze specific failure point** in action flow
3. **Implement targeted fix** based on root cause
