## 1) Set Up took longer than I thought it would.  The challenge was in installing tailwinds.  Instead of asking AI to fix it (it kept coming with variations of the same step) - have it ask for diagnostics, to understand where the error is coming from and then fix it.
## 2) API for BackEnd set to port 8080
## 3) Pending - Docker and also, Commiting to Git
