## 1) Set Up took longer than I thought it would.  The challenge was in installing tailwinds.  Instead of asking AI to fix it (it kept coming with variations of the same step) - have it ask for diagnostics, to understand where the error is coming from and then fix it.
## 2) API for BackEnd set to port 8080
## 3) Docker and Git Complete
## 4) Updated most of the backend.  Added Monte Carlo simulations where less than 5 cards are being sent for evaluation to trey.
## 5) Error remains in pot updates in the test case in game_engine.py.  Need to pick it up from here.
## 6)
