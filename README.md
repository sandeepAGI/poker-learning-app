# This game development is part of a training exercise to see if I could build a FS game without any prior experience only using LLMs.

1) Set Up took longer than I thought it would.  The challenge was in installing tailwinds.  Instead of asking AI to fix it (it kept coming with variations of the same step) - have it ask for diagnostics, to understand where the error is coming from and then fix it.
2) API for BackEnd set to port 8080
3) Docker and Git Complete
4) Updated most of the backend.  Added Monte Carlo simulations where less than 5 cards are being sent for evaluation to trey.
5) Updated logic for pot updates, increase in blinds and how bets are being made.
6) ALl unit tests passed.
7) Testing next AI decisions to make sure they are as expected.
8) How is call or fold handeled when SPR =0 ... the decision maker says call but we need to make sure that the logic in game_engine will force a fold if someone else raises.
9) Fixed errors in game_engine in how hands are dealt with to all players.  there were missing logic.
10) Need thorough testing of a game sequence

11) Effective stack and SPR calculation (by each player, before each round), was correct but variable to AIDecision maker was not in same order, mixing up calculations.  Fixed and also cleaned code to make sure the arguments being passes were correct using kwargs



#Always save to github once all testing on current passes before you add new functionality.  it sometimes overwrites prior code and difficult to restore.


üîπ Remaining Backend Tasks to Complete
üî∏ Phase 3: Statistics & API Integration
Statistics Tracking (statistics_tracker.py)

‚è≥ Track win/loss record for each player.
‚è≥ Monitor betting behavior of AI personalities.
‚è≥ Calculate pot odds and probability-based insights.
Backend API (api.py)

‚è≥ Implement /new_game to start a session.
‚è≥ Implement /get_state to fetch game status.
‚è≥ Implement /post_move to allow user moves.
‚è≥ Implement /get_statistics to provide learning insights.
üî∏ Phase 4: Final Testing & Deployment
Full Game Simulation

‚è≥ Run extended tests with AI and a human player.
‚è≥ Ensure blind progression and stack elimination work correctly.
Dockerization (Optional)

‚è≥ Set up Dockerfile for backend deployment.
