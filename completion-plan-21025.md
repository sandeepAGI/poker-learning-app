   - Player setup
   - Deck creation
   - Blind assignment

2. Hand Flow (Partial)
   - Deal hole cards
   - Post blinds
   - Basic betting round
   - Basic pot distribution

3. AI Decision Flow
   - Hand evaluation
   - Strategy application
   - Action selection

- Deck management flows down from game_engine through AI chain
- Hand evaluation flows up from base_ai through strategy classes
- Game state management centralized in game_engine.py

## 2. Backend Completion Phases

  - INFO: Game progression, state changes
  - WARNING: Unusual but handled situations
  - ERROR: Invalid states, calculation errors
  - CRITICAL: Game-breaking issues

### Production Phase
- Remove all print debugging
- Implement log rotation
- Add performance metrics
- Enable error tracking

## 6. Success Criteria

### Game Engine
- Complete hand played without errors
- Correct pot distribution
- Proper blind progression

- Correct chip tracking
- Valid AI behavior statistics
- No data loss between hands

## 7. Known Issues to Address

1. Deck management during AI decisions
2. Hand evaluation edge cases
3. Side pot calculations
4. Player elimination timing
5. Blind progression edge cases
