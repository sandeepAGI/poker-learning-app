# Poker Learning App - Refactoring Plan

## Project Status
This project has become too complex with over-engineering in the API and frontend layers. The core poker engine, AI strategies, and game logic are solid and should be preserved. We need to simplify the architecture while maintaining the excellent poker gameplay.

## Key Issues Identified
1. **Backend findings** (see BE-FINDINGS.md): Critical bugs in turn order, hand resolution after fold, raise validation, and side pot handling
2. **Over-engineered infrastructure**: Complex state management, chip ledgers, correlation tracking, WebSocket real-time updates
3. **Frontend complexity**: Multiple state management patterns, excessive abstractions, diagnostic tools in production code
4. **Documentation sprawl**: Multiple overlapping documentation files

## Refactoring Strategy
**Preserve the solid poker engine, simplify everything else.** Extract core game logic, build a simple API wrapper, create a clean frontend.

- [ ] Remove all complex middleware, correlation tracking, etc.

**API Endpoints**:
```python
POST   /games                    # Create new game
GET    /games/{game_id}          # Get game state
POST   /games/{game_id}/actions  # Submit player action
POST   /games/{game_id}/next     # Next hand
```

**Testing Checkpoint 2.1**:
```bash
# Start server
uvicorn main:app --reload

# Test endpoints
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/games -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"ai_count": 3}'
curl http://localhost:8000/games/{game_id}

---

## DOCUMENTATION MANAGEMENT POLICY

### Core Principle
**ZERO DOCUMENTATION SPRAWL**: Strictly control documentation growth to prevent the complexity we're trying to eliminate.

### Allowed Documentation Files (MAX 5)

1. **CLAUDE.md** (THIS FILE)
   - **Purpose**: Master refactoring plan and single source of truth
   - **Updates**: Phase completion, findings, discoveries
   - **Keep**: Concise summaries only, detailed analysis in Update History

2. **README.md**
   - **Purpose**: User-facing quick start and status
   - **Updates**: After Phase 4 only (final documentation)
   - **Keep**: < 200 lines, simple setup instructions

3. **BE-FINDINGS.md**
   - **Purpose**: Critical bugs reference
   - **Updates**: NEVER (historical record)
   - **Archive**: After Phase 1 when bugs are fixed

4. **REQUIREMENTS.md**
   - **Purpose**: What to preserve vs simplify
   - **Updates**: NEVER (historical record)
   - **Archive**: After Phase 2 when approach is validated

5. **ARCHITECTURE.md** (Create in Phase 4)
   - **Purpose**: Final design decisions
   - **Updates**: One-time creation in Phase 4
   - **Keep**: < 150 lines, design rationale only

### FORBIDDEN During Development

❌ **DO NOT CREATE**:
- No FINDINGS.md, ANALYSIS.md, REVIEW.md files
- No separate verification reports
- No phase-specific documentation
- No TODO.md, NOTES.md, THOUGHTS.md
- No duplicate documentation with different names

❌ **DO NOT LET GROW**:
- CLAUDE.md must stay < 600 lines (currently ~540)
- If it grows beyond 600 lines, archive old content
- Update History should be concise bullets, not essays

### Where to Put Findings

**During Development (Phases 0-3)**:
- ✅ **Critical discoveries**: Add to CLAUDE.md "Update History" as concise bullets
- ✅ **Bug findings**: Reference BE-FINDINGS.md (don't duplicate)
- ✅ **Code issues**: Add inline comments in code, not separate docs
- ✅ **Test failures**: In test output and git commit messages

**Example - GOOD**:
```
### 2025-10-18: Phase 0 Backend Review
- Reviewed REQUIREMENTS.md against actual code (poker_engine.py: 572 lines)
- Found: ChipLedger, StateManager, JWT don't exist (no removal needed)
- Found: Only 3 AI personalities (not 4), no Risk-Taker
- Found: File structure is single-file, not multi-directory
- Conclusion: Backend already simplified, focus Phase 1 on fixing 5 bugs
```

**Example - BAD**:
```
Created 250-line REQUIREMENTS-VS-REALITY.md with detailed analysis...
(This creates documentation sprawl)
```

### Documentation Review Checkpoints

**At End of Each Phase**:
- [ ] Count .md files in root (must be ≤ 5)
- [ ] Check CLAUDE.md line count (must be < 600)
- [ ] Archive historical docs to archive/docs-original/
- [ ] Remove any temporary analysis files

### Archive Strategy

**When to Archive**:
- BE-FINDINGS.md → Archive after Phase 1 (bugs fixed)
- REQUIREMENTS.md → Archive after Phase 2 (approach validated)
- DOCUMENTATION-REVIEW.md → Archive now (Phase 0 complete)

**How to Archive**:
```bash
mv OLD-DOC.md archive/docs-original/
# Add note to CLAUDE.md Update History
```

### Violation Response

**If documentation sprawls** (> 5 .md files or CLAUDE.md > 600 lines):
1. STOP work immediately
2. Consolidate into existing docs
3. Archive what's no longer needed
4. Delete redundant files
5. Update this policy if needed

### Success Metrics

**Phase 0**: ✅ 5 .md files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, BE-FINDINGS.md, REQUIREMENTS.md, DOCUMENTATION-REVIEW.md)
**Phase 1-3**: ≤ 5 .md files
**Phase 4**: ≤ 5 .md files (add ARCHITECTURE.md, archive BE-FINDINGS.md + REQUIREMENTS.md)
**Final**: Exactly 3 .md files (CLAUDE.md, README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md)

## UPDATE HISTORY

### 2025-10-18: Initial Refactoring Plan Created
- Created comprehensive phase-by-phase plan
- Added strict testing checkpoints at each step
- Established acceptance criteria
- Documented update procedures
- Added mandatory git commit/push requirements at end of each phase
- Ensures work is versioned at every milestone

### 2025-10-18: Phase 0 Completed
- Reviewed all documentation files (5 .md files audited)
- Created verification report for README_SIMPLE.md (claims vs reality)
- Archived original implementation:
  - `archive/backend-original/`: 701 lines Python (with known bugs)
  - `archive/frontend-original/`: ~6,300 lines (over-engineered)
  - `archive/docs-original/`: All obsolete documentation
- Created archive/README.md explaining what was archived and why
- Created new temporary README.md for refactoring period
- Updated CLAUDE.md with git commit requirements for each phase
- **Added Documentation Management Policy** to prevent sprawl (max 5 .md files)
- Repository ready for Phase 1

### 2025-10-18: Phase 0 Backend Review (REQUIREMENTS.md vs Reality)
**Reviewed**: REQUIREMENTS.md claims against actual backend code (poker_engine.py: 572 lines, main.py: 129 lines)

**Key Findings**:
- ✅ **Already simplified**: 701 lines total (within 500-800 target), NOT "2000+" as claimed
- ❌ **File structure wrong**: Claims game/, ai/strategies/, models/ directories don't exist - everything in one file
- ❌ **Removal claims false**: ChipLedger, StateManager, JWT, WebSockets, correlation tracking NOT present (already removed/never added)
- ✅ **Good features verified**: DeckManager clean, Treys+MonteCarlo excellent, AI decision tracking exceptional
- ⚠️ **3 AI personalities** (not 4): Conservative, Aggressive, Mathematical - no "Risk-Taker"
- ❌ **"Solid/excellent" contradicted**: 5 critical bugs from BE-FINDINGS.md prove it's buggy but fixable
- ✅ **Learning features**: HandEvent tracking, AI reasoning, action history all well-implemented
- ❌ **Missing features**: SPR calculations (claimed), side pots (required), proper turn order

**Critical Insight**: Backend has **good structure** but **critical bugs**. Not "excellent" - it's **buggy but well-organized**.

**Phase 1 Implication**: Focus on **fixing 5 bugs** (BE-FINDINGS.md), NOT removing complexity that doesn't exist.

**Documentation Strategy**: Use REQUIREMENTS.md for philosophy (what to value), NOT as facts (what exists).

### 2025-10-18: Phase 1 Completed - Core Backend Bugs Fixed (FINAL)
**Extracted**: `backend/game/poker_engine.py` (now 764 lines after all fixes)

**Bug Fixes Implemented** (7 total):
1. ✅ **Turn Order Enforcement** (Bug #1): Added `current_player_index`, `_get_next_active_player_index()`, out-of-turn rejection
2. ✅ **Fold Resolution** (Bug #2): Added `_betting_round_complete()`, hand continues after human fold via `_process_remaining_actions()`
3. ✅ **Raise Validation** (Bug #3): Minimum raise validation (current_bet + big_blind), proper rejection
4. ✅ **Raise Accounting** (Bug #4): Fixed current_bet update bug (was player.current_bet, now total_bet)
5. ✅ **Side Pot Handling** (Bug #5 - Enhanced): Multi-pot calculation, includes folded players' chips in pot distribution
6. ✅ **Chip Conservation** (Bug #6 - UAT): Fixed side pot logic to include ALL players' investments (even folded), added remainder distribution
7. ✅ **Game Hanging** (Bug #7 - UAT): Fixed `_process_remaining_actions()` to stop at unacted human player instead of skipping

**UAT Testing Revealed Additional Bugs**:
- **Bug #6**: Side pots excluded folded players' chips → 60 chips disappeared per hand
  - Fix: Lines 146-189 - Include all players' `total_invested` in pot calculations
- **Bug #7**: Game hung when human player's turn came mid-round
  - Fix: Lines 602-609 - Stop processing when human hasn't acted, don't skip them

**Test Suite Created**: 18 total tests across 5 files + UAT suite
- test_turn_order.py: 4 tests (turn enforcement, out-of-turn rejection)
- test_fold_resolution.py: 2 tests (hand continuation, pot award)

- test_complete_game.py: 4 tests (full game, multiple hands, AI personalities, learning features)
- PHASE1-UAT.md: 7 UATs (all passing)

**Test Results**: All tests passing ✅
- Automated: 2/2 core tests (Bug #1: 4/4, Bug #2: 2/2)
- UAT-1 through UAT-7: All passing
- Chip conservation verified: $4000 maintained throughout

**Key Technical Fixes**:
- Line 551, 635: `self.current_bet = total_bet` (was player.current_bet)
- Lines 146-213: Side pot logic includes folded players' chips
- Lines 602-609: Stop at unacted human player
- Remainder chip distribution in showdown

**Files Modified/Created**:
