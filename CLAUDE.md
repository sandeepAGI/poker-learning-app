Start by reviewing the README file and the codebase
When I start gameplay, I still see that my name is in the cache, it is not asking for it
Also, the players are not clearly marked in the screen
Please fix these two issues
Create new unit tests
Then run unit and regression tests
After completion, update README 
Shutdown any servers or programs that are still running prior to exit
