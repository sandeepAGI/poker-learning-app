Please review the README.md and associated codebase to gain a full understanding of current state
We developed FE functionality recently but havent tested all of them.
For example, currently you can register a new player and then create a new game but nothing happens after that.
Let us test the FE functionality individually and then through a similated game play
Update README once we have completed testing.
