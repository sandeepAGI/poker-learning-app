# Poker Backend Refactoring

This document outlines the major refactoring changes made to improve the poker backend application architecture.

## 1. Added Protocol-Based AI Strategy System

### Changes:
- Created `AIStrategyProtocol` in `ai_protocol.py` to define a consistent interface for all AI strategies
- Refactored all strategies to implement this protocol instead of inheriting from BaseAI
- Used composition rather than inheritance for hand evaluation logic
- Added proper type hints for better code verification

### Benefits:
- Clearer contract for what makes a valid AI strategy
- More flexibility for future strategy implementations
- Better type checking and IDE support
- Eliminated the need for inheritance which was causing subtle bugs

### Files modified:
- Created new: `ai/ai_protocol.py`
- Created new: `ai/hand_evaluator.py`
- Modified: `ai/strategies/conservative.py`
- Modified: `ai/strategies/risk_taker.py`
- Modified: `ai/strategies/probability_based.py`
- Modified: `ai/strategies/bluffer.py`
- Modified: `ai/ai_manager.py`
- Modified: `game_engine.py`

## 2. Implemented a DeckManager Class

### Changes:
- Created a dedicated `DeckManager` class to handle all deck operations
- Added proper validation and error checking for deck operations
- Included tracking of dealt and burnt cards
- Added utility methods for converting between card formats

### Benefits:
- Centralized deck management to prevent deck-related bugs
- Improved error handling for card dealing operations
- Better tracking of card state throughout the game
- Clear separation of concerns between game logic and deck operations

### Files modified:
- Created new: `deck_manager.py`
- Modified: `game_engine.py`

## 3. Added a Proper Logging System

### Changes:
- Created a centralized logging system in `logger.py`
- Replaced all print statements with proper logging
- Added different log levels (DEBUG, INFO, ERROR)
- Set up separate log files for different concerns (main app, errors, AI decisions)

### Benefits:
- Better debugging capabilities
- Proper separation of log messages by severity
- Consistent log format across the application
- No more debug statements cluttering production code

### Files modified:
- Created new: `logger.py`
- Modified: `ai/ai_manager.py`
- Modified: `game_engine.py`

## Additional Benefits

These refactorings provide several key improvements:

1. **Type Safety**: Added proper type hints throughout the codebase
2. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns makes the code easier to understand
3. **Extensibility**: New AI strategies and deck operations can be added more easily
4. **Debugging**: Better logging means easier troubleshooting
5. **Readability**: Better documentation and more consistent code style

All tests continue to pass after these refactoring changes, indicating that the functionality remains intact while the code quality has improved significantly.
