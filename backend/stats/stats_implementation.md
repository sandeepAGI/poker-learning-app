# Poker Statistics Tracking System: Overview, Implementation, and Testing Plan

## 1. System Overview

The Poker Statistics Tracking System is designed to help poker players improve their skills by analyzing their decisions, comparing them with AI strategies, and providing educational feedback. The system consists of several interconnected components:

### Core Features

1. **Decision Analysis**: Compares player decisions with different AI strategies to identify which strategy the player's approach most closely matches.

2. **Optimal Strategy Identification**: Determines which AI strategy would be optimal for each specific poker situation.

3. **Educational Feedback**: Generates detailed, educational feedback to help players understand the reasoning behind optimal decisions.

4. **Learning Progress Tracking**: Monitors player improvement over time, identifying trends in decision quality.

5. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies specific areas where a player can improve (e.g., pre-flop play, decisions at specific SPRs).

6. **Personalized Recommendations**: Provides tailored learning recommendations based on identified improvement areas.

### AI Strategy Types

The system evaluates decisions against four distinct AI strategies:

1. **Conservative**: Plays cautiously, preferring strong hands and minimizing risk.
2. **Risk Taker**: Uses aggressive play and pressure tactics.
3. **Probability-Based**: Makes mathematically sound decisions based on pot odds and expected value.
4. **Bluffer**: Makes unpredictable plays, using deception as a primary strategy.

## 2. Implementation Details

### 2.1 Architecture Components

The system is implemented with the following key components:

#### Statistics Management

- **StatisticsManager**: Central hub for all statistics operations, handling storage, retrieval, and lifecycle management.
- **PlayerStatistics**: Basic performance metrics for individual players.
- **SessionStatistics**: Game session tracking for detailed statistics.
- **LearningStatistics**: Focused on tracking decision quality and learning progress.

#### Decision Analysis

- **AIDecisionAnalyzer**: Analyzes player decisions by comparing them with AI strategies.
- **AIDecisionMaker**: Generates decisions from different AI strategy types.
- **Strategy Implementations**: Four distinct AI strategies with different decision thresholds.

#### Analysis and Feedback

- **FeedbackGenerator**: Creates educational feedback based on decision analysis.
- **HandAnalyzer**: Analyzes hand strength and provides related feedback.
- **PatternAnalyzer**: Identifies patterns in decision-making to find improvement areas.
- **RecommendationEngine**: Generates personalized learning recommendations.
- **TrendAnalyzer**: Analyzes trends in decision quality over time.

### 2.2 Key Algorithms and Workflows

#### Decision Classification

1. For a player decision, the system:
   - Gets decisions from all four AI strategies for the same game state
   - Finds which strategy most closely matches the player's decision
   - Identifies the optimal strategy for the situation
   - Records the comparison in the player's learning statistics

#### Strategy Matching Algorithm

1. Check for exact matches between player's decision and any strategy decision
2. If multiple exact matches exist, use a priority order: Probability-Based > Conservative > Risk Taker > Bluffer
3. If no exact match, find the closest action based on "action strength" (fold < call < raise)

#### Optimal Strategy Determination

Based primarily on:
- Stack-to-pot ratio (SPR)
- Game stage (pre-flop, flop, turn, river)
- Hand strength

With general rules like:
- Low SPR (<3): Favors commitment decisions
- Medium SPR (3-6): Favors calculated play
- High SPR (>6): Favors conservative pre-flop play and calculated post-flop play

#### Data Retention and Lifecycle

- Detailed decision history limited to most recent decisions (MAX_DETAILED_DECISIONS = 100)
- Session-based retention with pruning of oldest sessions (MAX_SESSIONS = 5)
- Aggregation of statistics for long-term storage with pruning of detailed data

### 2.3 Data Structures
