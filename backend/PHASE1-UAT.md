# Phase 1 - User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

## Overview
Manual verification tests to sign off on Phase 1 bug fixes. Run these interactively to confirm the poker engine behaves correctly.

---

**How**: Run the test suite
**Expected**: All core tests pass without errors

```bash
cd /Users/sandeepmangaraj/myworkspace/Utilities/Games/poker-learning-app/backend
python tests/run_all_tests.py
```

**Pass Criteria**:
- [ ] Bug #1 (Turn Order): PASSED
- [ ] Bug #2 (Fold Resolution): PASSED
- [ ] No errors or warnings

---

## UAT-2: Turn Order Enforcement
**What**: Verify players act in correct sequential order
**How**: Run interactive test

```bash
cd /Users/sandeepmangaraj/myworkspace/Utilities/Games/poker-learning-app/backend
python -c "
import sys
sys.path.insert(0, '.')
from game.poker_engine import PokerGame

# Create game
game = PokerGame('TestPlayer')
game.start_new_hand()

print('=== UAT-2: Turn Order Enforcement ===')
print(f'Initial dealer index: {game.dealer_index}')
print(f'Current player index: {game.current_player_index}')
print(f'Current player: {game.get_current_player().name}')

# Find human player
human_player = next(p for p in game.players if p.is_human)
human_index = game.players.index(human_player)

print(f'Human player: {human_player.name} (index {human_index})')

# Test 1: Out-of-turn action should fail
if game.current_player_index != human_index:
    result = game.submit_human_action('call')
    print(f'Out-of-turn action result: {result} (should be False)')
    assert result == False, '❌ FAIL: Out-of-turn action was allowed'
    print('✅ PASS: Out-of-turn action correctly rejected')
else:
    print('⚠️  Human is current player, skipping out-of-turn test')
    # Advance to next player
