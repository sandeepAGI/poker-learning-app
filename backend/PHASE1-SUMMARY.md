# Phase 1 Complete - Core Backend Bug Fixes

## Summary
Fixed all 5 critical bugs identified in BE-FINDINGS.md and created test suite to verify fixes.

## Bugs Fixed

### Bug #1: Turn Order Not Enforced ✅
**Problem**: AI players acted simultaneously instead of sequentially
**Fix**: 
- Added `current_player_index` to track whose turn it is
- Added `_get_next_active_player_index()` to advance turns
- Added `_betting_round_complete()` to check when round is done
- Added `has_acted` flag to Player class
**Test**: test_turn_order.py - 4/4 tests passing

### Bug #2: Hand Cannot Resolve After Human Folds ✅  
**Problem**: Game stalled when human folded because AI never acted
**Fix**:
- Modified `submit_human_action()` to call `_process_remaining_actions()` even after fold
- Created `_process_remaining_actions()` that processes all players in sequence
- Game now continues and reaches showdown even when human folds
**Test**: test_fold_resolution.py - 2/2 tests passing

### Bug #3: Raise Validation Missing ✅
**Problem**: Could raise any amount, including below minimum
**Fix**:
- Added minimum raise validation: `min_raise = current_bet + big_blind`
- Reject raises below minimum (unless all-in)
- Proper validation in `submit_human_action()`
**Code**: Lines 534-540 in poker_engine.py

### Bug #4: Raise Accounting Incorrect ✅
**Problem**: Double-counting chips in raise logic
**Fix**:
- Fixed raise accounting to use `bet_increment` not total bet twice
- Properly set `game.current_bet = total_bet` not `player.current_bet`
- Added `total_invested` field to Player for side pot tracking
- Fixed in both human and AI raise logic
**Code**: Lines 542-561, 625-645 in poker_engine.py

### Bug #5: Side Pots Not Implemented ✅
**Problem**: Winners split pot equally regardless of investment
**Fix**:
- Created `determine_winners_with_side_pots()` method
- Tracks per-player investment with `total_invested` field
- Creates multiple pots when players invest different amounts
- Distributes each pot to eligible winners
- Handles remainder chips correctly
**Code**: Lines 148-200, 684-704 in poker_engine.py

## Code Quality Improvements

### Added Features
- `current_player_index` - tracks turn order
- `has_acted` flag - prevents acting twice
- `total_invested` - tracks chips for side pots
- `reset_for_new_round()` - proper round reset
- `_betting_round_complete()` - validates round completion
- `_process_remaining_actions()` - sequential AI action processing

### Maintained Features
- ✅ All learning features (HandEvent, AIDecision tracking)
- ✅ All 3 AI personalities (Conservative, Aggressive, Mathematical)
- ✅ Hand evaluation with Treys + Monte Carlo
- ✅ Clean code structure in single file

## Line Count
- poker_engine.py: 750 lines (was 572, added ~180 for bug fixes)
- Tests: ~400 lines
- Total backend: ~1150 lines (within Phase 1 target)

## Next Steps - Phase 2
- Create simple FastAPI wrapper (4 endpoints)
- Test API integration
- Verify end-to-end game flow through API
